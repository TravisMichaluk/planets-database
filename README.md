The Eight Planets

    Mercury: The closest planet to the Sun is a small, cratered world with virtually no atmosphere. Because it lacks an "air blanket" to trap heat, it experiences the most extreme temperature swings in the solar system, ranging from scorching hot days to freezing nights.

    Venus: Often called Earth's twin due to its similar size, Venus is a hostile environment with a thick, toxic atmosphere of sulfuric acid clouds. A runaway greenhouse effect makes it the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.

    Earth: Our home is the only world known to support life, distinguished by its vast liquid water oceans and oxygen-rich atmosphere. It sits perfectly in the "Goldilocks Zone," where temperatures are just right for life to thrive and water to remain liquid.

    Mars: Known as the Red Planet due to iron-rich dust, Mars is a cold, desert world with a thin atmosphere. It features massive extinct volcanoes, deep canyons, and frozen polar ice caps, making it a primary focus for future human exploration.

    Jupiter: The largest planet in the solar system is a massive gas giant primarily made of hydrogen and helium. It is famous for its Great Red Spot—a storm larger than Earth that has raged for centuries—and its dozens of moons, including the volcanic Io.

    Saturn: Most famous for its spectacular and complex ring system made of ice and rock, Saturn is a gas giant so light that it would float in water. It possesses the highest number of confirmed moons, including the massive, atmosphere-shrouded Titan.

    Uranus: This "ice giant" is unique because it rotates on its side, likely due to a massive collision in its distant past. It has a pale blue-green color caused by methane in its cold atmosphere and features a faint set of vertical rings.

    Neptune: The most distant major planet is a dark, cold, and incredibly windy world. Deep blue in color, Neptune experiences supersonic winds—the fastest in the solar system—and is home to the Great Dark Spot, a massive rotating storm system.
